The Boston House Price Prediction refers to a machine learning project that aims to estimate the value of houses in the Boston area using various predictive models. This project typically involves analyzing a dataset containing features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, property tax rate, and others that influence house prices. The goal is to create a regression model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on these features.

Here’s a brief overview of what project entail:

- Data Collection: We’ll send a request to the specified URL to retrieve the Boston housing dataset.

- Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that have a significant impact on house prices.

- Model Building: Using machine learning algorithms XGBoost Regressor to build predictive models.

- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

- Prediction: Using the trained model to predict house prices given a set of features.
